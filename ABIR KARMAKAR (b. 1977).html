    <h1>ABIR KARMAKAR (b. 1977)</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Through his photorealistic oil paintings, Karmakar addresses the ruinations of identity, memory, and place. <br/> 
            His life-sized, site-specific compositions create a sense of uncanny voyeurism. The artist accurately renders depictions of domestic items, <br/>
            highlighting the social and temporal idiosyncrasies of modern India and its legacy of colonization by the British Raj. <br/>
            Karmakar's work is particularly significant for the Asian diaspora, as it explores and reflects the complexities of post-colonial identity, <br/>
            bridging cultural gaps and fostering a deeper understanding of shared histories and experiences. <br/>
            <em>«Through my paintings, I exaggerate identity, and interrogate the prevalent discomfort around ‘the other’»</em> <br/>
