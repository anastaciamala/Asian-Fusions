    <h1>KEERTHANA KUNNAH (b. 1973)</h1>

        <p>
            Keerthana Kunnah is an Indian-born, London-based artist who uses photography as a means to initiate conversations around socio-cultural issues. <br/>
            Seeing familiar Southeast Asian elements in fashion photography marks significant progress towards a more authentic and inclusive representation of the Asian diaspora. <br/>
Her work also challenges societal norms surrounding gender and sexuality and fosters dialogue on these topics, particularly within the broader South Asian community. <br/>
Through her practice, she creates a safe space for exploring these issues, both for the artist herself, but also for the spectators.
Generally in her work she blends fashion and documentary photography, creating a distortion between reality and fiction, binary and non-binary, in an effort to shed light on her community in contemporary visual culture. <br/>
<br/>
I often emphasize the importance of incorporating asian elements into fashion photography. Not only is it providing asian representation in a predominantly white industry, <br/>
but it also acts as an accessible entry point for viewers, a point of curiosity and questioning. 
Engaging with the visual aesthetics allows people to connect with the image on a <br/>
surface level before exploring the multilayered contexts behind it. As many children of the Asian diaspora struggle to restore harmony with their relationship to their home culture, <br/>
for Kunnath photography is an important tool in renegotiating her relationship with India. Itâ€™s helping her create the visual world she craved as a kid as it is cultivating new modes <br/>
 of creativity and inclusiveness for the future generations.
