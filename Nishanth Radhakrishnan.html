    <h1>Nishanth Radhakrishnan</h1>

        <p>
            Nishanth Radhakrishnan, born in Kerala, India and raised in Tamil Nadu, was acknowledged by i-D as one of the ‘20 rising photographers to follow’. 
            <br/> Despite featuring in Vogue, Harper’s, Dazed and Cosmopolitan, he is not as well known as his images. Whether it is from cultural bias and familiarity or the representation gap <br/> we’re experiencing, I don’t know. 
            <br/> Nonetheless, Radhakrishnan is a photographer of remarkable versatility, as his style and use of the camera is constantly evolving.
            His work is fueled by an appreciation for nature, culture, fashion and femininity, often capturing these elements with a sensitivity that bridges traditional Indian culture and values with modern aesthetics.
            <br/> There’s a sense of nostalgia for his home culture that I really appreciate in his work. 
            He effortlessly combines old traditions in how he handles the medium and the subjects with contemporary visual storytelling. 
            I've long anticipated his work gaining more recognition in the West, as his imagery is relatable and easy to engage with. 
            While his commercial and fashion photography draws inspiration and elements from his cultural roots, it doesn't overwhelm viewers with complexity. 
            While being approachable for a wide audience, <br/> it allows for an immediate connection before encouraging further exploration.
