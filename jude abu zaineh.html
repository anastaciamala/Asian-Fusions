    <h1>JUDE ABU ZAINEH (b. 1990)</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Jude Abu Zaineh is a Palestinian-Canadian multidisiplinary artist. <br/>
            Her practice employs art, food, and technology to investigate meanings of culture, displacement and belonging. 
            She examines ideals of home and community while working to develop aesthetics rooted in her childhood and upbringing in the Middle East. 
            Through the food she gives another dimension to the notion of cultural identity and allows <br/>
            symbols to freely migrate creating intimate reflections on an art of displacement and diaspora. <br/>
            She looks at how cultural heritage fluctuates, grows, diminishes through the medium of food and technology. Food is highly related to diaspora as it's a common element <br/>
            and creates the feeling of community and belonging. 
            Using science which has a very systematic methodology to explore cultural heritages which tend to be disorientating and dysfunctional is interesting, and she says she finds comfort in things being a bit organised.
